# -Federated-Learning-Step-by-Step-with-Flower-and-PyTorch-
Get started with Flower Welcome to the Flower federated learning tutorial!  In this notebook, weâ€™ll build a federated learning system using Flower and PyTorch. In part 1, we use PyTorch for the model training pipeline and data loading. In part 2, we continue to federate the PyTorch-based pipeline using Flower.
